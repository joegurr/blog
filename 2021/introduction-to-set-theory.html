                        "Every mathematician agrees that every mathematician must know some set theory;
                        the disagreement begins in trying to decide how much is some."

                <h3>What is a set</h3>

                <p>A set is a collection of "things".</p>

                <p>What "things" you may ask? Almost anything you'd like ...</p>

                <p>A collection of three colours, red, blue, and yellow is a set. So is the collection of the names of
                    capital cities of Australia (or the world for that matter).</p>

                <p>We write a set by enclosing the collection of "things" inside \(\{\text{brackets}\}\) with commas
                    separating the different objects.</p>

                <p>e.g. \(\{\text{North}, \text{East}, \text{South}, \text{West}\}\) is a set</p>

                <p>Often we consider sets that contain numbers. Other times we consider sets that contain sets!</p>

                <p>e.g. \(\{17, 42, 108\}\) is also a set</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Properties of sets</h3>
                <p>Sets do not care about multiples of the same "thing", nor do they care about order</p>

                <p>e.g. \(\{\text{cat}, \text{dog}\}\) is the same as \(\{\text{cat}, \text{dog}, \text{cat}\}\)</p>

                <p>e.g. \(\{1, 2, 3\}\) is the same as \(\{3,2,1\}\)</p>

                <p>We use the symbol \(\in\) to represent "membership" to a set.</p>

                <p>We write \(1 \in \{1,2,3\}\) to say, 1 is a "member of" (or "belongs to")
                    the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\). \(4 \notin \{1,2,3\}\).</p>

                <p>We usually denote a set with a capital letter (usually starting at the start of the alphabet).</p>

                <p>We generally denote members of the set with a lower case letter (usually from the end of the
                    alphabet).</p>

                <p>For example you will often see something like. Let \(x\) be a member of the set \(A\)</p>

                <p>If all the members in one set, say set \(A\) , also belong to another set, say set \(B\) ,
                    we say that \(A\) is a subset of \(B\) We write this as \(A \subseteq B\)</p>

                <p>\(B\) may very well contain more "things" than \(A\)</p>

                <p>For example the set \(\{1,2,3\} \subseteq \{\cdots, -2, -1,0,1,2,\cdots\}.\)</p>

                <h3>Some famous sets</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The counting numbers \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \cdots\}\),
                        otherwise known as the Natural Numbers, denoted by \(\mathbb{N}\)</li>
                    <li>The Integers \(\{\cdots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \cdots\}\) denoted by \(\mathbb{Z}\)</li>
                    <li>The Rational Numbers, i.e. those numbers that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers,
                        denoted
                        by \(\mathbb{Q}\)</li>
                    <li>The Real Numbers, denoted by \(\mathbb{R}\)</li>
                    <li>The set with no members \(\{\}\), otherwise known as the Empty Set, denoted by \(\emptyset\)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>What can we do with sets</h3>

                <p>Create a new set by combining the members of other sets. We call this the <strong>Union</strong> of
                    sets.
                    We write the union of two sets \(A\) and \(B\) as \(A \cup B\).</p>

                <p>e.g. Let \(A = \{a, b, c\}\) and let \(B = \{x, y\}\), then \(A \cup B = \{a, b, c, x, y\}\)</p>


                <p>Create a new set by including only the common members of other sets. We call this the
                    <strong>Intersection</strong> of sets.
                </p>

                <p>We write the intersection of two sets \(C\) and \(D\) as \(C \cap D\).</p>

                <p>e.g. Let \(C = \{-2, 0, 2\}\) and let \(D = \{-1, 0, 1\}\), then \(C \cap D = \{0\}\)</p>

                <p>Count them ... well, kind of, ... We call this the <strong>Cardinality</strong> of a set.</p>
                <p>Formally it is not really a "count", but we will get to that another day!</p>
                <p>The number of elements (the Cardinality) of a set \(A\) is is denoted by \(|A|\)</p>

                <p>e.g. Let \(A = \{a, b, c\}\), then \(|A| = 3\).</p>

                <h3>Generating rules</h3>
                <p>We often write a set explicitly, by listing out all of the elements in the set.</p>

                <p>This doesn't work when we want to write out infinite sets.</p>

                <p>In these cases we use a "generating rule" (or rules) to define how a set is generated.</p>

                <p>For example, we could define the even integers the following way: \(\{2x \text{ such that } x \in
                    \mathbb{Z}\}\)</p>

                <h3>Some of the big results of set theory</h3>
                <p>I'd like to end this post by briefly bringing up some of the most famous results of Set Theory.
                    I want to give the beginning of an answer to the question "Why do we care about sets?"</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Formal ways of building the real numbers (via Dedekind cuts for example)</li>
                    <li>There are more real numbers than natural numbers (Cantor's Diagonalisation Argument)</li>
                    <li>Mathematics doesn't play as nice as we would have liked (Godel's Incompleteness Theorems)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
