          This is my second attempt at creating a personal blog. I created one
          last year using Jeykll hosted using github pages, but for some reason
          I just didn't like it much.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would like to attribute the inspiration for this new blog and my
          choice of it's underlying technology (<b>pure HTML and CSS</b>) to
          <a href="https://steren.fr/">Steren Giannini</a> and his article
          <a href="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/"
            >My stack will outlive yours</a
          >.
        </p>

          If you are reading this in early 2021 the two sites may look identical
          in style. My intention is not to keep it this way, however I just
          think that Steren's design looks great.
