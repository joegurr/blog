                <p>Recently I have been using <a href="https://pandera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">pandera</a> at
                <code>$WORK</code>.</p>
                <p>It is a package that allows one to validate and test against dataframe-like objects. </p>
                <p>The following is a quick reminder for myself how I have been using it.</p>

                <p>Given a pandas dataframe called <code>df</code>, you can infer a schema as follows.</p>

<pre>
<code>import pandera as pa

schema = pa.infer_schema(df)

print(schema.to_script())
</code>
</pre>

                <p>This schema is a structure of the dataframe you have provided.</p>

                <p>Invariably I have to go back and update this schema, as it will have picked up specific qualities of
                    the particular dataframe I provided, rather than the generic structure.</p>

                <p>I have found this process to be very useful as it forces you to think deeply about what you would
                    like to validate against.</p>

                <p>Once corrected I take this schema and add it to the repo I'm working in. I usually have been having
                    one module per schema. I also have been adding the following function to each module (even though I
                    know there is a better way of doing this):
                </p>

<pre>
<code>def validate(df, logger):
    # Returns the df if validated else None
    try:
        return schema.validate(df)
    except pa.errors.SchemaError as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to validate: {e}")
        return None
</code>
</pre>
