                <p>I finally did it! This year I started a masters in mathematics in person. This has been a very long
                    time coming, and has been the culmination of a lot of daydreaming and a lot of difficult decisions.
                </p>
                <p>I’m not sure where I want it to take me yet, however I do know that learning more mathematics is
                    loads of fun.
                </p>
                <p>To be honest, I’m having a bit of a crisis of my mathematical conscience. I am struggling to choose
                    my courses. I have two ideals in my mind at all times, these ideals are best explained as
                    mathematicians I aspire to be like.
                </p>
                <p>On one hand I have Richard Hamming and on the other Paul Halmos. I haven't satisfactorily ruminated
                    on this enough to write anything meaningful about it, so I will leave this for another post, but it
                    is there.
                </p>
                <p>I am finding it difficult to add things to this blog seeing as how much excellent mathematics
                    communication is out there. I feel like I'm not even adding a drop to the bucket of mathematics
                    content. Nevertheless I am going to stick with it, out the belief that by continuing to write about
                    mathematics I will get better at it.</p>
