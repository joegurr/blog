                <p>I have resisted trying out nix for quite some time now.</p>

                <p>Tonight was the night that my curiosity got the better of me.</p>

                <p>I have read many articles about how nix can be intimidating and confusing.</p>

                <p>I fully expect that to come, but for now things are making sense.</p>

                <p>I haven't made it too far through the nix.dev tutorials yet, but I will continue to do so and write about what I learn.</p>
