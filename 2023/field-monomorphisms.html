                <p>Recall that a morphism \(f: X \to Y\) in a category is a monomorphism if for any \(g, h: Z \to X\) then \( fg = fh \implies g = h\).</p>

                <p>We want to understand what are the monomorphism in the category of fields.</p>

                <p>Let <strong>Field</strong> denote the category of fields. Recall that Ob(<strong>Field</strong>) are
                    fields and Mor(<strong>Field</strong>) are field homomorphisms.</p>

                <p>Let \(f:X \to Y\) be a morphism. As \(f\) is a field homomorphism we know that the kernel of \(f\) is an
                    ideal.</p>

                <p>The only ideals in \(X\) are \(\{0\}\) and \(X\). If ker(\(f\)) was the whole field, then \(f\) would be the
                    zero morphism, which is not a field homomorphism.</p>

                <p>So ker(\(f\)) \( =\{0\}\), which tells us that \(f\) is injective.</p>

                <p>Now, let \(h, k\) be a pair of parallel morphisms from \(Z\to X\) such that composition with \(f\) is
                    sensible and \(fh = fk\).</p>

                <p>Towards a contradiction, suppose that \(h \neq k\), then there exists an \(z \in Z\) such that \(h(z)
                    \neq k(z)\).</p>

                <p>As \(f\) is injective would then have \(f(h(z)) \neq f(k(z))\) violating the assumption that \(fh=fk\).
                </p>

                <p>Therefore we must have \(h=k\) meaning that \(f\) is a monomorphism. Since our choice of \(f\) was
                    arbitrary we have that all morphisms in <strong>Field</strong> are monomorphisms. \(\blacksquare\)
