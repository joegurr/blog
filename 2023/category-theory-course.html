                <p>I am currently taking a reading course on category theory, and it is hard. The book we are working
                    through is Emily Riehl’s Category Theory in Context.</p>

                <p>I think Emily Riehl is one of the coolest people around, but I am struggling through her book. I
                    think it is because I am not a part of the target audience.</p>

                <p>While I am taking this reading course I am also taking my first course in abstract algebra. I have
                    done a lot of my own reading and know the basics of Groups, Rings, and Fields. However not yet
                    completing a course in algebra kind of means that I don't really have the prerequisites for Emily's
                    book.</p>

                <p>I have found Steve Awodey’s Category Theory a much easier book to read. I am also working through
                    Paolo Aluffi's Algebra: Chapter 0.</p>

                <p>My current understanding is that the core concept of category theory is not really categories, or
                    functors, but rather natural transformations, and that the other concepts are defined as a
                    consequence of wanting to understand natural transformations better.</p>

                <p>Natural transformations are meant to capture the idea that a transformation does not depend on any
                    arbitrary choices, that it is there ripe for the taking.</p>

                <p>I'm enjoying learning category theory, although it is stretching me. Right now we're just about to
                    prove the Yoneda Lemma, which I intend to write about soon.</p>
