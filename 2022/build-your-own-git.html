          <p>Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x">Build Your Own X</a> I decided that I really wanted to build <a href="https://github.com/joegurr/joegit">my own git</a>.</p>
          <p>I'm a big git fan, and have helped teach many engineers the basics to get them up to speed.</p>
          <p>git is the tool I always wanted before I knew it existed. I still wish I had the power of git at my fingertips when I was writing English papers at school.</p>
          <p>I definitely recommend working through <a href="https://www.leshenko.net/p/ugit/#">this tutorial</a> if you'd like to learn more about how git works under the hood.</p>
