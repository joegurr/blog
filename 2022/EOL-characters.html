                <p>This week at work I had an issue with end of line characters. Basically I'm working with an
                    enterprise document generation platform that accepts data in whatever form you'd like, transforms
                    it, and produces a nice pretty output.</p>
                <p>For this particular job we were sent an xlsx file, for this job our software is programmed to accept
                    csv files, so I had to convert one file format into another. Easy enough.</p>
                <p>I don't have a microsoft account on my machine (because I don't need one), so this involved me
                    opening up the spreadsheet in an unlicensed version of Excel and copying the data into a text editor
                    and running a program like sed over it to reformat it. Pretty simple.</p>
                <p>When the data get's complex sometimes I have to open the xlsx file with Mac's Numbers and export to a
                    csv from there.</p>
                <p>I hunted a bug for about 2 hours this week simply because the export function from Mac's Numbers and
                    the 'reformat in a text editor' method resulted in different end of line encodings.</p>
                <p>I'm not going to make that mistake again ...</p>
                <p>I'm learning a lot about how different tools (Windows and Microsoft) serve different purposes to
                    those I'm used to. I'm not sure how much I like using these tools, but I'm glad to be exposed to
                    them.</p>
