                Today was the first day of my masters (graduate diploma?).

                Of my own choice I am studying remotely. I know that this will come with some challenges.

                I thoroughly enjoyed my first class, titled Probability for Inference.

                It is about formal probability theory, which I am really looking forward to learning more about.

                Algebra was upsetting dull. I have been really looking forward to it. I'm sure it will get better!

                Then I watched the lecture for Optimisation for Industry. This course probably isn't for me.

                However, I did learn something neat. I didn't know that when you impose integer constraints on an optimisation
                model, the models become harder to solve.

                I'm not sure what I'm aiming to accomplish writing this masters blog, however I think it might have some value.
