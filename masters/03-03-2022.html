                Today I skipped a lecture for the first time :(

                I skipped Algebra to have lunch with a dear friend of mine.

                I asked a stupid question in Functional Analysis. I couldn't understand where the continuity of \(f\) could come from in the following metric space
                \(C[0,1] = (\{f: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \text{ | f is continuous}\}, d_\infty)\)

                Turns out it is regular old Euclidean continuity that is just inherited on the way, and \(d_\infty\) is the metric on the functional space ... silly me

                Probability is fun! Although, I feel like I should just be taking it as a measure theory course.
