                Today I taught in the morning, then had probability and algebra. While the material in Algebra is
                awesome, I am personally finding it hard to engage in lectures. I think I'll be much better off working
                out of a book. Probability is great! I am very happy to see a lot of really cool analysis theorems
                coming up all of the time.

                I'm a bit tired! Still not sure this is for me. I have another class to teach this evening. A little bit
                pooped!
