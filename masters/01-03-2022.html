                Today I read an excellent essay by Nikolai Vavilov called "Reshaping the metaphor of proof". The argument
                being made is that thinking about a proof as simply text is very wrong. A proof is an interactive,
                deeply human experience. This article led me to a talk on Univalent Foundations by Vladimir Voevodsky, a
                Fields medalist. It was a very interesting talk. I completely understand the motivation and the quest
                for a way to "eliminate" (in some sense) mistakes. I would be incredibly surprised if Univalent
                Foundations is able to do that.

                Today was also my first class in Functional Analysis. I am a bit nervous about it.
