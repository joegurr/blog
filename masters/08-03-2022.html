                I spent this morning reviewing probability theory work. I'm afraid that there is more than a little of
                it that I don't feel entirely comfortable with. I still don't like the expressions for \(A_n\)
                occurring infinitely (or finitely) often. I expect there will be another entry in this diary about them.

                Then I had functional analysis. We did a sketch of the proof of the Arzela-Ascoli theorem, which, when
                applied to \((C[0,1], d_\infty)\) says that every bounded equicontinuous family admits a convergent
                subsequence. Basically we are getting a notion of 'pre-compact' sets of functions.
