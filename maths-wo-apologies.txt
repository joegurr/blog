Mathematics without apologies

The book begins with an assessment of the apologies for pure mathematics. They are basically broken down into three types: goodness, truth, and beauty. Harris feels that these are incomplete, and give little explanation as to what mathematics is truly about, nor about the intentions of mathematicians. Instead he feels that the sense of contributing to an established tradition, it being a relaxed field, and the pursuit of pleasure are better 'apologies' (not the apologies are needed).

The theme of the second chapter is that the content of mathematics is caught up with a hierarchical charismatic structure. What Harris is getting at with their use of the word 'charisma' isn't the typical one. Harris' use refers to status, and value, and other hard to describe qualities. I think John Conway exemplifies charisma in both senses.

I read chapter three, and then jumped straight to chapters nine and ten after reading that recommendation in a review.
