    <h2>Technology Dating Profile</h2>
    <p>I'm an experienced developer who has mostly worked with Python and Javascript codebases.</p>
    <p>However, I pride myself in being a generalist. I believe that having strong foundations in computer science rather than any particular technology or framework is the right way to go.</p>
    <p>While of course I have my own technology preferences I firmly believe that by studying broadly and deeply you put yourself in a position to make well informed technology decisions in the future.</p>
    <p>Things I like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I like solving real problems for real people. I like to be close to the end user.</li>
        <li>I like working on problems that I believe in.</li>
        <li>I like git, vim, shell, tmux, linux, and open source.</li>
        <li>In general I like and agree with the <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">choose boring technology</a> approach to solving problems.</li>
        <li>I like to use the correct tool for the job at hand. This means that I use certain operating systems, programming languages, and other software for some tasks, and a totally different set of tools for other tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Things I don't like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I don’t like bloaty, wasteful applications (... although who does).</li>
        <li>I don’t like social media (... look, I’m not against it completely, but I do think what we’ve currently got does not work for me and for a lot of others).</li>
        <li>I don’t like the shady digital marketplace of personal data, including marketing and advertising technology.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Experience</h2>

        <li>CSS. I've used the SASS and SCSS frameworks.</li>
        <li>HTML. I've written a lot of raw HTML, but much prefer when I can use a templating language like razor, blade, or jinja2.</li>
    </ul>
